### Publications
Text generation and automatic writing have gradually been one of the frontiers for the artificial intelligence community. To facilitate the development of the text generation filed, we summarize existing researches and give an overview of their technical implementations in this tutorial. We focus on creative and artistic writing, including storytelling, poetry composition, multi-modal poetry/story generation, and lyrics creation. Moreover, we will elaborate on the "core" challenges of artistic text generation and existing advanced solutions.

### Selected Awards




### Academic Services (Program Committee or Reviewer)
Our target audience are researchers and practitioners with some deep learning and text generation background who are interested in artistic writing (e.g., couplet generation, poetry composition, and story writing) and the technologies behind the prosperity of artistic writing in industry and academia, or would like to learn how to build a story/poetry/couplet generation systems with the state-of-the-art technologies. We have no special requirement for the proposed tutorial
